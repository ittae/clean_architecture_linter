# Clean Architecture Linter Validation PRD

## Product Overview

**Product Name**: Clean Architecture Linter Validation Framework
**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Purpose**: Comprehensive validation of the clean_architecture_linter package against Clean Architecture principles, Flutter best practices, and industry standards

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the validation framework for the `clean_architecture_linter` package to ensure it meets the criteria for being a successful, production-ready linting tool for Flutter projects following Clean Architecture principles. The validation will cover architectural correctness, exception handling patterns, framework integration, and practical usability.

## Problem Statement

Currently, the clean_architecture_linter package has implemented various lint rules, but there is no systematic validation to ensure:
1. Rules correctly enforce Clean Architecture principles
2. Exception handling patterns align with layer responsibilities
3. Flutter framework integration follows best practices
4. The package provides practical value for real-world projects
5. Rule coverage is comprehensive and balanced

## Goals and Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
1. **Architectural Correctness**: Verify all rules correctly enforce Clean Architecture layer boundaries and dependencies
2. **Exception Handling Validation**: Ensure exception patterns are appropriate for each layer
3. **Flutter Best Practices**: Confirm alignment with Flutter framework conventions
4. **Practical Usability**: Validate the package provides actionable guidance for developers
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensure critical architectural violations are detected

### Success Metrics
- 100% of implemented rules correctly enforce their intended architectural principle
- All three layers (Domain, Data, Presentation) have appropriate exception handling rules
- Zero false positives in good example code
- 100% detection rate for bad example violations
- Documentation clarity score ≥90% (developer comprehension test)
- Package passes all industry-standard linting and security checks

## Target Audience

### Primary Users

- Notifiers should use StateNotifier or AsyncNotifierProvider

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Rule detects ViewModel usage (discouraged pattern)
- Rule validates Freezed state usage
- Rule checks state class responsibilities
- Error messages explain proper state management

#### 3.2 UI Extension Pattern
**Requirement**: Ensure UI-specific logic uses extensions correctly
**Test Cases**:
- Extensions should be in the same file as the class (State or Entity)
