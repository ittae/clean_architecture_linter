## [1.0.4] - 2025-10-22

### ‚ú® Added (2 new rules)

- **widget_no_usecase_call rule** - Enforce proper Riverpod architecture: Widget ‚Üí Provider ‚Üí UseCase
  - Prevents widgets from directly importing or calling UseCases
  - Enforces proper separation: Widgets should only interact with Providers
  - Detects UseCase imports in widget/page files
  - Detects direct UseCase provider calls via `ref.read()` or `ref.watch()`
  - Provides comprehensive correction messages with proper Riverpod patterns
  - Severity: WARNING

- **widget_ref_read_then_when rule** - Prevent anti-pattern of using `.when()` after `ref.read()`
  - Detects `ref.read()` followed by `.when()` in the same function
  - Enforces proper patterns: `ref.watch()` + `.when()` for UI, `ref.listen()` for side effects
  - Prevents misuse of AsyncValue state management
  - Explains why this pattern is incorrect (state is already settled after operation)
  - Provides three correct alternatives based on use case
  - Severity: WARNING

### üîÑ Changed

- **presentation_no_throw rule** - Enhanced detection capabilities
  - Now checks `/providers/` directory in addition to `/states/` and `/state/`
  - Improved State/Notifier class detection with three methods:
    1. Detects `@riverpod` annotation (Riverpod Generator pattern)
    2. Detects `extends AsyncNotifier/Notifier/StateNotifier/ChangeNotifier`
    3. Detects generated classes with `_$` prefix
  - More robust validation of Riverpod-based state management classes
  - Better coverage of modern Riverpod code generation patterns

- **Total rules: 31** (was 29 in v1.0.3)
  - Added: 2 new presentation layer rules
  - Modified: 1 rule (presentation_no_throw)

### üìù Documentation

- Enhanced CLAUDE.md with comprehensive Riverpod state management patterns
  - Added 3-tier provider architecture documentation
  - Documented Entity Providers (AsyncNotifier), UI State Providers (Notifier), and Computed Logic Providers
  - Added detailed examples of AsyncValue.when() pattern usage
  - Included common violations and their solutions
  - Comprehensive Widget usage examples with proper error handling

## [1.0.3] - 2025-10-17

### ‚ú® Added (3 new rules)

- **model_entity_direct_access rule** - Enforce `.toEntity()` method usage instead of direct `.entity` property access in Data layer
  - Prevents direct `.entity` access in Repository and DataSource implementations
  - Allows direct access inside extension methods (where conversion logic is implemented)
  - Allows direct access in test files
  - Provides clear architectural boundaries for Model ‚Üí Entity conversion

- **model_naming_convention rule** - Enforce naming conventions for Models in Data layer
  - Models must end with `Model` suffix
  - Validates proper naming in `data/models/` directories
  - Helps maintain consistent codebase structure

- **presentation_no_throw rule** - Enforce no exception throwing in Presentation layer
  - Presentation layer should use AsyncValue for error handling
  - No direct exception throws in widgets, states, or notifiers
  - Aligns with Riverpod best practices

### üîÑ Changed

- **model_conversion_methods rule** - Updated to align with Dart/Freezed best practices
  - Now only requires `toEntity()` method in extensions (mandatory)
  - `fromEntity()` implementation is optional and should use factory constructors in the Model class
  - Removed extension static method pattern (not idiomatic in Dart)
  - Updated error messages to guide users toward factory constructor pattern

- **Total rules: 29** (was 26 in v1.0.2)
  - Added: 3 new rules
  - Modified: 1 rule (model_conversion_methods)

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed `exception_naming_convention` rule to skip `core/` directory (framework-level exceptions)
- Fixed `failure_naming_convention` rule to skip `core/` directory
- Fixed data file detection to correctly exclude `domain/repositories/` from data layer
- Fixed `model_conversion_methods` rule incorrectly requiring extension static methods
- Improved error severity levels across multiple rules

### üìù Documentation

- Updated CLAUDE.md with comprehensive `.entity` access control guidelines
- Updated Data Layer rules README with all 3 new rules documentation
- Enhanced Model conversion pattern examples with factory constructor approach
- Added 48 new lines of documentation in CLAUDE.md
- Added 55 new lines in Data Layer README
- Updated README.md with accurate rule count

### üìä Statistics

- **Files changed**: 23 files
- **Lines added**: ~1,237 lines
- **New test coverage**: 398+ lines of new tests for new rules
- **Documentation improvements**: 100+ lines across multiple files

## [1.0.2] - 2025-10-09

### üóëÔ∏è Removed

- **entity_business_logic rule** - Removed overly strict rule requiring all entities to have business logic methods
  - Not all entities need business logic (e.g., events, DTOs, value objects)
  - Users reported this as too restrictive for practical use cases
  - Total rules: 27 ‚Üí 26

### üìù Documentation

- Fixed incomplete code snippet in README.md examples section
- Synchronized README_KO.md structure with README.md (removed inconsistent sections)
