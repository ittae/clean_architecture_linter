## [1.0.4] - 2025-10-22

### ‚ú® Added (2 new rules)

- **widget_no_usecase_call rule** - Enforce proper Riverpod architecture: Widget ‚Üí Provider ‚Üí UseCase
  - Prevents widgets from directly importing or calling UseCases
  - Enforces proper separation: Widgets should only interact with Providers
  - Detects UseCase imports in widget/page files
  - Detects direct UseCase provider calls via `ref.read()` or `ref.watch()`
  - Provides comprehensive correction messages with proper Riverpod patterns
  - Severity: WARNING

- **widget_ref_read_then_when rule** - Prevent anti-pattern of using `.when()` after `ref.read()`
  - Detects `ref.read()` followed by `.when()` in the same function
  - Enforces proper patterns: `ref.watch()` + `.when()` for UI, `ref.listen()` for side effects
  - Prevents misuse of AsyncValue state management
  - Explains why this pattern is incorrect (state is already settled after operation)
  - Provides three correct alternatives based on use case
  - Severity: WARNING

### üîÑ Changed

- **presentation_no_throw rule** - Enhanced detection capabilities
  - Now checks `/providers/` directory in addition to `/states/` and `/state/`
  - Improved State/Notifier class detection with three methods:
    1. Detects `@riverpod` annotation (Riverpod Generator pattern)
    2. Detects `extends AsyncNotifier/Notifier/StateNotifier/ChangeNotifier`
    3. Detects generated classes with `_$` prefix
  - More robust validation of Riverpod-based state management classes
  - Better coverage of modern Riverpod code generation patterns

- **Total rules: 31** (was 29 in v1.0.3)
  - Added: 2 new presentation layer rules

### üîÑ Changed
